# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is repository contains my personal [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) keymap repository.  You can find it on [this file](keyboards/handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x6/keymaps/dp1/keymap.c).


My layout focuses on my RSI recovery. 

Features:
* Keyboard centric operating system usage.  
* Eye tracker integration.
* Symmetric mouse and operating system navigation.
